An energy efficient framework for UAV-assisted millimeter wave 5G heterogeneous cellular networks
We study downlink transmission in a multi-band heterogeneous network comprising unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) small base stations and ground-based dual mode mmWave small cells within the coverage area of a microwave (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mu W$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) macro base station. We formulate a two-layer optimization framework to simultaneously find efficient coverage radius for the UAVs and energy efficient radio resource management for the network, subject to minimum quality-of-service and maximum transmission power constraints. The outer layer derives an optimal coverage radius/height for each UAV as a function of the maximum allowed path loss. The inner layer formulates an optimization problem to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE), defined as the ratio between the aggregate user data rate delivered by the system and its aggregate energy consumption (downlink transmission and circuit power). We demonstrate that at certain values of the target SINR <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\tau $ </tex-math></inline-formula> introducing the UAV base stations doubles the EE. We also show that an increase in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\tau $ </tex-math></inline-formula> beyond an optimal EE point decreases the EE.

Wildfire monitoring in remote areas using autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles
In this paper, we propose a drone-based wildfire monitoring system for remote and hard-to-reach areas. This system utilizes autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the main advantage of providing on-demand monitoring service faster than the current approaches of using satellite images, manned aircraft and remotely controlled drones. Furthermore, using autonomous drones facilitates minimizing human intervention in risky wildfire zones. In particular, to develop a fully autonomous system, we propose a distributed leader-follower coalition formation model to cluster a set of drones into multiple coalitions that collectively cover the designated monitoring field. The coalition leader is a drone that employs observer drones potentially with different sensing and imaging capabilities to hover in circular paths and collect imagery information from the impacted areas. The objectives of the proposed system include: i) to cover the entire fire zone with a minimum number of drones, and ii) to minimize the energy consumption and latency of the available drones to fly to the fire zone. Simulation results confirm that the performance of the proposed system- without the need for inter-coalition communications- approaches that of a centrally-optimized system.

Distributed cooperative spectrum sharing in UAV networks using multi-agent reinforcement learning
In this paper, we develop a distributed mechanism for spectrum sharing among a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and licensed terrestrial networks. This method can provide a practical solution for situations where the UAV network may need external spectrum when dealing with congested spectrum or need to change its operational frequency due to security threats. Here we study a scenario where the UAV network performs a remote sensing mission. In this model, the UAVs are categorized to two clusters of relaying and sensing UAVs. The relay UAVs provide a relaying service for a licensed network to obtain spectrum access for the rest of UAVs that perform the sensing task. We develop a distributed mechanism in which the UAVs locally decide whether they need to participate in relaying or sensing considering the fact that communications among UAVs may not be feasible or reliable. The UAVs learn the optimal task allocation using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is discussed and simulation results are presented for different scenarios to verify the convergence.

Wildland fire detection and monitoring using a drone-collected RGB/IR image dataset
Drone-based Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) provide an efficient means for early detection and monitoring of remote wildland fires due to their rapid deployment, low flight altitudes, high 3D maneuverability, and ever-expanding sensor capabilities. Recent sensor advancements have made side-by-side RGB/IR sensing feasible for UASs. The aggregation of optical and thermal images enables robust environmental observation, as the thermal feed provides information that would otherwise be obscured in a purely RGB setup, effectively "seeing through" thick smoke and tree occlusion. In this work, we present Fire detection and modeling: Aerial Multi-spectral image dataset (FLAME 2) [1], the first ever labeled collection of UAS-collected side-by-side RGB/IR aerial imagery of prescribed burns. Using FLAME 2, we then present two image-processing methodologies with Multi-modal Learning on our new dataset: (1) Deep Learning (DL)-based benchmarks for detecting fire and smoke frames with Transfer Learning and Feature Fusion. (2) an exemplary image-processing system cascaded in the DL-based classifier to perform fire localization. We show these two techniques achieve reasonable gains than either single-domain video inputs or training models from scratch in the fire detection task.

Maximizing energy efficiency of cognitive wireless sensor networks with constrained age of information
A cognitive wireless sensor network is considered, where a cluster of secondary sensors utilize channel vacancies of a primary network and transmit their measurement samples to a common sink node. We propose a joint framing and scheduling policy that optimizes energy efficiency of communication system under strict constraints on the expected age of information. The age of information is defined as the timespan from the sampling epoch to the successful delivery of the samples to the sink node including framing time, queuing time, waiting time for channel vacancies, and transmission time. First, we develop a number-based framing policy to determine the number of samples bundled into data packets with constant header sizes. Then, we quantify the impact of this policy on the age of information and communication energy efficiency by characterizing the utilized queuing dynamics, packet discard rate, and retransmission probability. The derived closed-form expressions for the age of information and energy efficiency are used to regularize packet lengths based on the current sampling rate, channel quality, and channel utilization rate by primary users. The proposed method can be used to develop low-cost and energy-efficient network of unlicensed sensors for delay sensitive applications such as body area sensor networks.
