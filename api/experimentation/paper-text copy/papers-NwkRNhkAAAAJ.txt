Substitutional Reality: Using the physical environment to design virtual reality experiences
Experiencing Virtual Reality in domestic and other uncontrolled settings is challenging due to the presence of physical objects and furniture that are not usually defined in the Virtual Environment. To address this challenge, we explore the concept of Substitutional Reality in the context of Virtual Reality: a class of Virtual Environments where every physical object surrounding a user is paired, with some degree of discrepancy, to a virtual counterpart. We present a model of potential substitutions and validate it in two user studies. In the first study we investigated factors that affect participants' suspension of disbelief and ease of use. We systematically altered the virtual representation of a physical object and recorded responses from 20 participants. The second study investigated users' levels of engagement as the physical proxy for a virtual object varied. From the results, we derive a set of guidelines for the design of future Substitutional Reality experiences.

Similarity-based forecasting with simultaneous previews: A river plot interface for time series forecasting
Time-series forecasting has a large number of applications. Users with a partial time series for auctions, new stock offerings, or industrial processes desire estimates of the future behavior. We present a data driven forecasting method and interface called similarity-based forecasting (SBF). A pattern matching search in an historical time series dataset produces a subset of curves similar to the partial time series. The forecast is displayed graphically as a river plot showing statistical information about the SBF subset. A forecasting preview interface allows users to interactively explore alternative pattern matching parameters and see multiple forecasts simultaneously. User testing with 8 users demonstrated advantages and led to improvements.

Evaluating immersive experiences during Covid-19 and beyond
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our daily lives . The safety and well-being of people are paramount, and there is no exception for the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. Most universities and research labs have closed non-critical research labs. With that closure and the student populations having left campus, in-person user studies have been suspended for the foreseeable future. Experiments that involve the usage of specialized technology, such as virtual and augmented reality headsets, create additional challenges. While some head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become more affordable for consumers (e.g., Oculus Quest), there are still multiple constraints for researchers, including the expense of high-end HMDs (e.g., Microsoft Hololens), high-end graphics hardware, and specialized sensors, as well as ethical concerns around reusing equipment that comes in close contact with each participant and may be difficult to sterilize. These difficulties have led the extended reality (XR) community (which includes the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) research communities) to ask how we can continue to practically and ethically run experiments under these circumstances. Here, we summarize the status of a community discussion of short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures to deal with the current COVID-19 situation and its potential longer-term impacts. In particular, we outline steps we are taking toward community support of distributed experiments. There are a number of reasons to look at a more distributed model of participant recruitment, including the generalizability of the work and potential access to target-specific, hard-to-reach user groups. We hope that this article will inform the first steps toward addressing the practical and ethical concerns for such studies [1]. There are currently no strong ethical guidelines

MobiSurf: Improving Co-located Collaboration through Integrating Mobile Devices and Interactive Surfaces
One of the most popular scenarios for advertising interactive surfaces in the home is their support for solving co-located collaborative tasks. Examples include joint planning of events (e.g., holidays) or deciding on a shared purchase (e.g., a present for a common friend). However, this usually implies that all interactions with information happen on the common display. This is in contrast to the current practices to use personal devices and further, most people's behavior to constantly switch between individual and group phases because people have differing search strategies, preferences, etc. We therefore investigated how the combination of personal devices and a simple way of exchanging information between these devices and an interactive surface changes the way people solve collaborative tasks compared to an existing approach of using personal devices. Our study results clearly indicate that the combination of personal and a shared device allows users to fluently switch between individual and group work phases and users take advantage of both device classes.

Virtual reality games for people using wheelchairs
Virtual Reality (VR) holds the promise of providing engaging embodied experiences, but little is known about how people with disabilities engage with it. We explore challenges and opportunities of VR gaming for wheelchair users. First, we present findings from a survey that received 25 responses and gives insights into wheelchair users' motives to (non-) engage with VR and their experiences. Drawing from this survey, we derive design implications which we tested through implementation and qualitative evaluation of three full-body VR game prototypes with 18 participants. Our results show that VR gaming engages wheelchair users, though nuanced consideration is required for the design of embodied immersive experiences for minority bodies, and we illustrate how designers can create meaningful, positive experiences.

Feet movement in desktop 3D interaction
In this paper we present an exploratory work on the use of foot movements to support fundamental 3D interaction tasks. Depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect are now able to track users' motion unobtrusively, making it possible to draw on the spatial context of gestures and movements to control 3D UIs. Whereas multitouch and mid-air hand gestures have been explored extensively for this purpose, little work has looked at how the same can be accomplished with the feet. We describe the interaction space of foot movements in a seated position and propose applications for such techniques in three-dimensional navigation, selection, manipulation and system control tasks in a 3D modelling context. We explore these applications in a user study and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this modality for 3D UIs.
